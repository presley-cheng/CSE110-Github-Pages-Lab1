## Who I am as a Programmer
I am the kind of programmer who likes to ***play*** around with new learned techs and
***breaking*** them. I enjoy working through possible solutions for a problem just as
much as coding them. Coding is an absolute soothing experience to me. I am always
curious in finding new ways to solve something.
## Who I am as a Person
I am an introvert who enjoys video games, movies, basketball, and badminton.
